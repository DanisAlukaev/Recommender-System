## Overview
The goal of the assignment was to finalize the implementation of a movie recommendation system in Scala. Moreover, it was required to use Spark framework and implement it not only on local Hadoop cluster but also on Private Network Hadoop cluster.

To finalize implementation, team implement `parseTitle` and `rmse` functions; post-processing of recommendations; method that allow to load user data directly instead of surveying user. Moreover, the team will run the application with different model ranks, compare and evaluate the differences between baseline and prediction for the model with a higher rank. In addition, low-frequency items will be excluded from the training and recommendation process.
